# Learning body pose using neural networks
In this exercise we try to predict the position of elbows, knees, front and back based on input from a virtual reality headset and controllers.
Take a look at [these slides](https://uob-my.sharepoint.com/personal/lb17101_bristol_ac_uk/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?docid=0cb898751d07a41a4b909cbda5235801f&authkey=AZ8tTilg0tIpO80VyfcwZDA&expiration=2017-12-20T17%3a06%3a45.000Z) for a short overview of the problem as well as [this video](https://github.com/davidglo/ML-CHAMPS-Sept2017/blob/master/vr/documentation/body-tracking-screen-grab.mp4?raw=true)

## Required packages:
