# Learning body pose using neural networks
In this exercise we try to predict the position of elbows, knees, front and back based on input from a virtual reality headset and controllers.
Take a look at [these slides](https://github.com/davidglo/ML-CHAMPS-Sept2017/tree/master/vr/documentation/body-tracking-outline.pdf) for a short overview of the problem as well as [this video](https://github.com/davidglo/ML-CHAMPS-Sept2017/tree/master/vr/documentation/body-tracking-screen-grab.mp4)

## Required packages:

1. pandas
2. seaborn
3. scikit-learn

## Visualisation:
The renderer for visualising the predictions can be found in the bin folder
