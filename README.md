# ML-CHAMPS-Sept2017

Welcome to the Sept 2017 CHAMPS machine learning workshop!

This workshop is designed to help you gain familiarity with some of the machine learning learning tools available in Python, so that you can think about applying these tools to your own workflows.

The schedule for the day is as follows:

10.00am - 10.30am Welcome Session, with coffee, tea, and biscuits!

10.30am - 12.30pm Morning Session: Introduction to the python data science pipeline using a handwritten digits classification example formulated by Rob Arbon

12.30pm - 2.00pm Lunch (provided)

2.00pm – 5.00pm Afternoon Session: Time to explore some simple examples of machine learning applications
