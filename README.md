# ML-CHAMPS-Sept2017

Welcome to the Sept 2017 CHAMPS machine learning workshop, which has been co-created by Rob Arbon, Silvia Amabilino, Lars Bratholm, Mike O'Connor, and David Glowacki

This workshop is designed to help you gain familiarity with some of the machine learning learning tools available in Python, so that you can think about applying these tools to your own workflows.

## Timetable
* 10.00am - 10.30am Welcome Session, with coffee, tea, and biscuits!

* 10.30am - 12.30pm Morning Session: Introduction to the python data science pipeline
    * Rob Arbon: [Training a support vector machine to undertake handwritten digits classification](digitClassification/digits.md)

* 12.30pm - 2.00pm Lunch (provided)

* 2.00pm – 5.00pm Afternoon Session: Time to explore some simple machine learning application examples
    * Lars Bratholm & Mike O’Connor: [Training a neural net to learn body coordinates in virtual reality](vr/learningBodyPose.md)
    * Silvia Amabilino: [Kernel ridge regression to learn potential energy surfaces](pes/learningPESs.md)

Note: This course assumes that you have a working version of python3, preferably installed using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
