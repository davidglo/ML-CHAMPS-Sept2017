1. Scikit learn
2. Seaborn
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib
5. Numpy

## Exercise 2

The second exercise focuses on fitting a potential energy surface for a simple system of a methane interacting with a cyanide radical. 

The packages required for this exercise are:

1. Scikit learn
2. Seaborn
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib
5. Numpy
