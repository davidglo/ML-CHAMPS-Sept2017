# Fitting potential energy surfaces with neural networks

For a short introduction to why neural networks are being used to fit potential energy surface, you can have a look at these [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Qak8kyw-53VFJNIj1ijKaClboxogFoIMY_f62O1DedI/edit?usp=sharing). In this folder there are two exercises. 

## Exercise 1
The first exercise is aimed at a beginner and focuses on fitting a quadratic function with a neural network. 

The packages required for this exercise are:

1. Scikit learn
2. Seaborn
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib
5. Numpy

## Exercise 2

The second exercise focuses on fitting a potential energy surface for a simple system of a methane interacting with a cyanide radical. 

The packages required for this exercise are:

1. Scikit learn
2. Seaborn
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib
5. Numpy
